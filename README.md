# Boniface
C ++ web framework (fast_cgi)

This library allows you to quickly prototype your web applications in C++. If you need to build a small but convenient web server in C++, you can safely use Boniface.<br />
<br />
The goal of the project is to reduce the complexity of developing the backend in C++, since most of the available frameworks for C++ are quite difficult to install and configure, Boniface provides you with an easy and intuitive API for creating a Backend application.<br />
<br />
First of all, we are focused on RESTfull applications, so we do not have templates and template engines, and we also leave it up to you to work with the database and serialize/deserialize data.<br />
<br />
Overall we are getting inspired koa.js flask and bottle. I hope you enjoy it, good luck!<br />
<br />
I use libfcgi  and libfcgi-dev for this project
